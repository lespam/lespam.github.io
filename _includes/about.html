      <h2>Leslie: <br> Developer and Activist 🌈</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Leslie Brenes, a software developer and a social justice advocate. This is my story of how I found my purpose
        as a person and a professional.</p>

      <h3>My Journey 🚀</h2>
      <p>I started as a computer engineer who loved technology and wanted to help people. I dreamed of creating amazing
        products that would make the world a better place. But it wasn't easy. I faced many challenges and obstacles
        along the way.</p>

        <p>Through life I have experienced bad UX and bad quality that made the products confusing, unusable or defective. 😢
        <br> I had to deal with people who couldn't understand each other or communicate effectively.
        <br> I had to deal with people who were always connected to their devices and forgot about human interactions. 
        <br> I had to deal with people who wasted their talent and work, spending time and money on things that didn't focused on the users.
        <br> None of these things were the users fault. They were the fault of the people who created them. 🚨
      </p>


      <p>So, I didn't give up. I decided to learn everything I could about humans, psychology, sofware and design principles. 🧠
        I decided to change my perspective and see problems as opportunities to solve. I decided to ensure actions that enable
        systems where people can communicate securely and efficiently. 🔐 
        <br>I decided to push for a digital transformation that makes people more engaged and happy. 😊</p>

      <h2>My Skills 💻</h2>
      <p>I learned how to code in Python, shell programming Linux and PowerShell, SQL, Java, Blockchain, network
        protocols, user experience, and more. 🙌 I worked on various projects for different companies, websites, and
        software. 🚀 I helped improve the quality, functionality, and reliability of their products and services. 💯</p>

      <h2>My Projects 📚</h2>
      <p>One of the projects that I'm most proud of is Cara a Cara, an installation that uses facial recognition
        technology to create an exercise of memory and awareness about the disappearance in Mexico. It identifies
        similarities between the face of the person who experiences the installation and the faces of thousands of
        people who have disappeared in Mexico. 😢 We wanted to preserve and promote the memory and dignity of these
        people, as well as raise awareness and empathy among the public. 💖</p>

      <p>Another project that I really enjoyed working on was Justicia Transparente, a tool that analyzes and visualizes
        the sentences issued by the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico. 🇲🇽 It uses natural language processing and
        machine learning techniques to extract relevant information from the sentences, such as the topics, actors,
        arguments, and votes involved. 🧠 It also allows users to explore and compare the sentences according to
        different criteria, such as date, chamber, minister, or type of case. 📊 We wanted to improve the transparency
        and accountability of the judicial system in Mexico, as well as foster civic engagement and education. 👏</p>

      <h2>My Life 💕</h2>
      <p>I also met my partner on a Discord server about economics. He was from the US. Online we were actively there for each other. 💖 We fell in love and got married. 💍 I moved and
        we live in the US with our dog Timea. 🐶 We worked from home together and enjoyed our life playing Overwatch 2. 😍</p>

      <h2>My Mission 🌟</h2>
      <p>Now I'm a software developer and a social justice advocate (mainly diversity and inclusion, women issues, inequality, and animal welfare). 🌈 I fulfilled my dream and have helped many people with
        my technology and skills. 💪 I made the world a better place for everyone with quality assurance, UX, and outstanding products. ✨</p>

      <p>How do I do it? Well, it wasn't easy. As a college student, I engaged in several student activities and clubs. 
        I earned a BS. in Computer Engineering and met a lot of people. I used empathy and active listening to understand
         the needs of the people involved in my projects, and I designed technology solutions that met those needs. 
         It took me a lot of hard work, perseverance, and luck. 😅 But it was also fun. And rewarding. And sometimes hilarious.</p>

      <p>Like the time when I accidentally deleted the entire database of a project that I was working on. 😱 Or the
        time when I deleted the main branch of our economics discord bot and wrote some gibberish code that made no
        sense. 😂 Or the time when I met my other half online and thought he was a troll because he had such a weird username.
        😜</p>

      <p>But hey, that's life. You never know what's going to happen next! You just have to be ready for anything. And
        learn from your mistakes. And laugh at yourself sometimes.</p>

      <h2>My Offer 👋</h2>
      <p>That's my story of how I learned and grew as a person and a professional. Technology is my way of connecting with people and making a difference in their lives.</p>

      <p>Do you want to work with me? Do you need help with your software development or quality assurance needs? Do you
        want to learn more about my skills or projects? Do you want to chat with me about anything?</p>

      <p>If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you're in luck.</p>

      <p>I'm available for hire as a freelance software developer or QA consultant. 👩‍💻 I can help you with web
        development, data analysis, user experience design, testing tools and frameworks, security protocols, blockchain
        technology, network protocols, and more.</p>

      <p>I'm also available for speaking engagements or interviews on topics such as software development, quality
        assurance, neurodiversity advocacy, social justice activism, and culture preservation, online education
        platforms, and more.</p>
