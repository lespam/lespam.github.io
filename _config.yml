user_description: I'm passionate about all things tech! Ever since I was a kid, I was always the one helping other people out with difficulties with the computer and reading the documentation. <br>
                  I've worked on Software Development for over 5 years. <br>
                  When I'm using an app, I'm always taking note on  the user flow design and the issues I find. I love to do User Research, and being a visionary of the potential tech innovations of tomorrow. I'm also a hard worker, in my time as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer, I work daily on things that involve software design, writing source code, reviewing code, testing, documenting, debugging and ensuring compliance. I have a "focus and flow!" mentality when I'm stimulated, and constantly push myself to go beyond expectations. Above all -- I just love doing what I do, testing, coding, making content related to technology, and helping people with what I create. <br>
                  I would love to contribute my talents to your brand and show how much of an asset I can be to your team. <br>
                  Contact me, if you'd like to work with me, feel free to reach out! <br>
